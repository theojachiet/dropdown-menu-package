# DropDown menu in vanilla JS
To use this package, simply import the dropdown menu package with npm and import its displayDropDown() function.
It takes a wrapper (a dom div element), a title (string), and a list of items to drop down (an array of strings).
I may add an option to choose between click and hover to make the list appear.
